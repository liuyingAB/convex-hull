# convex-hull
2D projection script:The three-dimensional model is projected in two dimensions to obtain the two-dimensional projection data of  plants from multiple perspectives. 
convex hullscript :based on the fast convex hull algorithm, the Plant two dimensional Convex Hull was constructed from multiple perspectives, and the distribution range and corner change rate of each corners of the convex hull were analyzed.
